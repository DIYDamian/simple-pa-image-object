# Damian's Image Thing ngl
This is a simple tool used to recreate simple one-color images into text objects for use in Project Arrhythmia.
## How to use
There are two ways to use the tool.
### Executable (Recommended!)
Go to the Releases tab and download the thing. 

Download img2txt.py. Run the file in the command prompt with the following command:
```
python img2txt.py
```
Once it's started, input the file name or path of your image. If all goes well, it should generate a .txt file with text to copy into a text object. I'll write more stuff here later uhhhhhhh
