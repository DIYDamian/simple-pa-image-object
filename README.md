# Damian's Image Thing ngl
This is a simple tool used to recreate simple one-color images into text objects for use in Project Arrhythmia.
## How to use
Download img2txt.py. Run the file in the command prompt with the following command:
```
python img2txt.py
```
Once it's started, input the file name or path of your image. If all goes well, it should generate a .txt file with text to copy into a text object. I'll write more stuff here later uhhhhhhh
